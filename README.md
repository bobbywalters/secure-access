Secure Access plugin for WordPress
==================================
Provides additional security for your site by requiring users to log in before gaining access to content.

Notes
-----
As of right now there aren't any options to configure. The plugin enables security by being activated. Simply deactivating the plugin will turn off the need to log in before seeing content.

Feeds are secured as well.
